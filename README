jPaToH supplies Java bindings for PaToH[1]. To be able to compile the package
you'll need a recent JDK that is compatible with JNA[2]. Steps to follow are
presented below.

1. Issue "ant jar" command to build the "jpatoh.jar" file.

             $ cd jpatoh
   .../jpatoh$ ant jar

2. Run below command to see if everything works properly.

   .../jpatoh$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libpatoh.so  \
               java                                  \
               -cp build/jar/jpatoh.jar:lib/jna.jar  \
               tr.edu.bilkent.cs.patoh.examples.Test \
               /patoh/to/some/patoh/hypergraph/file

3. Now you're wondering the magic, don't you? See "Test.java" under
   "src/tr/edu/bilkent/cs/patoh/examples" directory. (To see the full list of
   exported functions, consult to the javadoc specification of "HyperGraph"
   class in "doc" directory.)

Comments, bug reports, etc. are welcome.
